## Development Roadmap

The following section lists all of our current (and)
planned versions for the bot, with incremental updates
to make the bot's elo go stonks. Currently, most of the
features are stolen from Rustic Chess's development
guide, which can be found [here](https://rustic-chess.org/introduction/introduction.html).

Note that the planned features are not final and
may change any time.

## Version 0.0.1 (Planned) - UCI & Random Moves

Version 0.0.1 of the bot should be able to:

1. Communicate with GUIs through UCI
2. Understand how chess pieces move and;
3. Randomly pick a correct move and play

Estimated ELO: `Not Tested`
